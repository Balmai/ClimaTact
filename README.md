# ClimaTact
This repo aims to study the evolution of historical temperature, rain, discomfort index throughout the world.
It uses data free to use data for research only which you can get download on gsod site.

Don't forget to change paths before executing main.

Also comment decompression code once you have run it one time already.

Code could be greatly enhanced: 
- We use a linear regression on highest temperatures. We should rather fit a parametric density to histogram, then apply regression to its parameters. OR anything else :)
- Outlier data should be cleaned to get more consistent maps
- Data for some countries is poor
